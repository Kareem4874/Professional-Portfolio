# Mastering TypeScript

TypeScript has become the de facto standard for building scalable JavaScript applications. Let's explore advanced concepts that will take your TypeScript skills to the next level.

## Generic Types

Generics allow you to write reusable, type-safe code:

```typescript
function identity<T>(arg: T): T {
  return arg;
}

// Usage
const result = identity<string>("hello");
const num = identity<number>(42);
